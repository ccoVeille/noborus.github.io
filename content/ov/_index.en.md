## Features

`ov` provides a more convenient function by separating text,
not only the pager function to display at the terminal size.

* Specify a fixed line to be displayed as a header.
* Table-formatted text can be interpreted as a column by the delimiter.
* Text can be interpreted as a section by splitting the line with a delimiter.
* [Supports files larger than memory](memory).

## Use case
