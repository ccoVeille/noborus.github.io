## Search condition

Last time, we sorted columns, extracted, and sorted rows, so this time we will extract rows.
To extract rows, add WHERE and write the search condition.

We will use the same example file as last time.

```console
trdsql -ih "SELECT id, \`name\` FROM header.csv WHERE id=1"
```

```
1,Orange
```

This is the main feature of SQL. Just write the search condition and you can output the corresponding rows.

## AND, OR

You can write complex conditions by using AND, OR, and () parentheses.

```console
trdsql -ih "SELECT id, \`name\` FROM header.csv WHERE id='1' OR id='2'"
```

```
1,Orange
2,Melon
```

```console
trdsql -ih "SELECT id, \`name\` FROM header.csv " "WHERE (id='1' OR id='2') AND \`name\`='Orange'"
```

```
1,Orange
```

As mentioned last time, trdsql treats the values of CSV, LTSV, and JSON as text types. Therefore, when you write the condition with "=", you don't have to be aware of the type so much, but when you specify the range, the result will change, so you need to CAST.

```console
trdsql -ih "SELECT id,\`name\` FROM header.csv " "WHERE CAST(id as int)>1"
```

```
2,Melon
3,Apple
```

When using SELECT, you can use CAST in the column specification to specify the CAST column for the search condition or ORDER BY.

In that case, the original column name refers to the column before CAST, so use `AS alias` to use the column name after CAST (you can give the original name to the column name after CAST).

```console
trdsql -ih "SELECT CAST(id AS int) AS id,\`name\` FROM header.csv WHERE id>1"
```

```
2,Melon
3,Apple
```

## IN

IN is a convenient operator that allows you to specify multiple values in a single condition.

```console
trdsql -ih "SELECT * FROM header.csv WHERE id IN ('1','3')"
```

```
1,Orange
3,Apple
```

IN can also be used to specify multiple columns at once.

```console
trdsql -ih "SELECT * FROM header.csv WHERE 'Apple' IN (id,name)"
```

```
3,Apple
```
